Numerous fountains and green areas make walking through it enjoyable. For dining, this place is an excellent alternative to a restaurant terrace.

The college's historic campus in the heart of Dublin houses architectural landmarks such as the Old Library, home to the Book of Kells, a 9th-century illuminated manuscript. Trinity College has a distinguished reputation for academic excellence and has produced many notable alumni, including writers like Jonathan Swift and Samuel Beckett, political figures such as Mary Robinson, and scientists like William Rowan Hamilton. Today, it is a leading research university, attracting students from around the world.</p>",

We were able to see the Book of Kells and other renowned items such as the Nobel Prize medal and Viking artifacts.After the visit, you can stroll through the park and explore the gardens. This place is very touristy and, unfortunately, somewhat a victim of its own success.</p>"

The landscapes are beautiful, offering vibrant nature to adventurers who dare to venture off the beaten path. Two trails allow you to discover the Irish coast and then head back down to the town to continue your visit. At the port, you can enjoy an ice cream in a rather pleasant atmosphere. A special mention goes to Gino Gelato: generous, though somewhat pricey, ice creams. The town is full of small streets just waiting to be explored. We saw a lot animals there, like seals, auks and cormorants. </p>"

Throughout the visit, actors are there to immerse you in the Viking era, doing history reenactment.

Located on the south bank of the River Liffey, it was named after Sir William Temple, a rector of Trinity College in the 17th century. Historically, Temple Bar was an important commercial and artisanal center. Over the centuries, it has experienced periods of decline and revival. In the 1990s, the district was revitalized and transformed into a vibrant cultural hub, known for its cobblestone streets, lively pubs, art galleries, unique shops, and artistic events. Today, Temple Bar is a must-visit place for both locals and visitors, celebrated for its vibrant atmosphere and rich historical heritage, and is probably the most known neighborhood in Dublin. </p>",
                tab2Content: "<h3>Our review</h3><p>During the day, this festive-looking neighborhood is calm, resembling an ordinary district of Dublin. However, in the evening, the area comes to life. A meeting place for Dublin's youth and tourists, the Temple Bar district animates the city's nightlife. Be careful when choosing a bar because many only accept adults aged 21 and over (the age of majority in Ireland). As a result, we were turned away several times before finally settling in a bar. With the noise and the lack of effort from the Irish to understand English, you will need to repeat your order several times. The pint at 10 euros was a bit off-putting, to be honest. The bars capitalize heavily on their reputation and the location that is Temple Bar. However, the atmosphere is good with singing and dancing. Don't expect to find a seat in the famous Temple Bar itself as it is full from 5 PM to 2 AM. The neighborhood is lively, with a great atmosphere, and is close to public transportation that runs until the early morning. However we strongly recommend ordering from other bars outside this area, as just by walking 100 to 200 meters you could find drinks for a fraction of the price.</p>"

About one million people died from starvation and disease, and another million emigrated, mainly to the United States and Canada, to escape the misery.The Famine Memorial, located in Dublin, pays tribute to these victims. Designed by artist Rowan Gillespie, it consists of bronze sculptures depicting emaciated and desperate figures, symbolizing the distress of the famine victims. This memorial is a poignant reminder of this historical tragedy and its profound impact on the Irish people and their diaspora.</p>",

There, you can learn about the terrible famine that took millions of lives in the 1840s. It is a very emotional encounter between the tragic past of Dublin and modern art. Despite the explanations on the memorial board, a guide would probably be better to explore and understand the history of the Irish nation. In fact, when we arrived, we saw a group of tourists with a guide who explained the story of Dublin. We quietly listened to the explanations and thought that having a professional guide was a good idea to discover Dublin. The statues are modern art and represent the inhabitants of the city, but it is a small memorial.</p>"
