It's an accessible hike, but make sure to have at least some proper equipment, as with simple sneakers, the hike quickly becomes challenging. The landscapes are beautiful, offering vibrant nature to adventurers who dare to venture off the beaten path. Two trails allow you to discover the Irish coast and then head back down to the town to continue your visit. At the port, you can enjoy an ice cream in a rather pleasant atmosphere. A special mention goes to Gino Gelato: generous, though somewhat pricey, ice creams. The town is full of small streets just waiting to be explored.

On the first floor, visitors learn about the four key ingredients and Arthur Guinness's 9,000-year lease on the St. James's Gate Brewery.

Indeed, when you reach the top, you can enjoy a pint or a soft drink at the Gravity Bar, with a 360-degree view of Dublin.However, the museum is a victim of its own success, and the bar is often crowded with no available seating. Fortunately, we were able to sit on the floor below, but we noticed the number of beers and glasses left uncollected on the tables. Despite considerable efforts by the cleaning staff, the museum suffers somewhat from its popularity.But the ambiance was very cool, we had a tasting experience of a glass of guiness, and then a pint. Guiness in bars tend to be a bit bland, but the ones we had there were good, and a kind mister gave us drinks vouchers he didn’t want so we even took some more pints. We will overall strongly recommend this place, and think this might be one of the places to imperatively visit in Dublin</p>"

It houses an extensive and diverse collection of European and Irish art, spanning from the medieval period to the present day. The gallery is renowned for its impressive holdings of works by renowned artists such as Caravaggio, Vermeer, Rembrandt, Goya, and Monet.A highlight of the collection is Caravaggio's The Taking of Christ, a masterpiece that draws numerous visitors. The gallery also boasts a substantial representation of Irish art, featuring prominent figures like Jack B. Yeats, William Orpen, and Mainie Jellett.The building itself is a blend of classical and modern architecture, having undergone significant expansions and renovations over the years, most notably the addition of the Millennium Wing in 2002. The gallery provides a dynamic cultural experience with temporary exhibitions, educational programs, and public lectures. Admission is free, making it an accessible cultural destination for both locals and tourists.The National Gallery of Ireland is not just a repository of art but also a vibrant hub for cultural engagement and education, reflecting the rich artistic heritage of Ireland and Europe.</p>",
                tab2Content: "<h3>Our feedback</h3><p>The gallery itself is pretty big, and is structured in numerous wings with different themes.During the visit, you'll see a lot of paintings from different times, different subjects and different styles. A lot of the paintings are about the christ or other religious theme, which makes sens considering that the country was catholic in the past, and even today catholicism is still the most practiced religion there by a large margin. You'll also get to see more modern and realistics art at the end of the visit.While we liked it, if you're not really into art you might want to prefer going to other places firts, as we do not think it's a mandatory place to visit. </p>"

                tab1Content: "<h3>History</h3><p>The Temple Bar district in Dublin is one of the city's oldest and most iconic areas. Located on the south bank of the River Liffey, it was named after Sir William Temple, a rector of Trinity College in the 17th century. Historically, Temple Bar was an important commercial and artisanal center. Over the centuries, it has experienced periods of decline and revival. In the 1990s, the district was revitalized and transformed into a vibrant cultural hub, known for its cobblestone streets, lively pubs, art galleries, unique shops, and artistic events. Today, Temple Bar is a must-visit place for both locals and visitors, celebrated for its vibrant atmosphere and rich historical heritage, and is probably the most known neighborhood in Dublin. </p>",
                tab2Content: "<h3>Our feedback</h3><p>During the day, this festive-looking neighborhood is calm, resembling an ordinary district of Dublin. However, in the evening, the area comes to life. A meeting place for Dublin's youth and tourists, the Temple Bar district animates the city's nightlife. Be careful when choosing a bar because many only accept adults aged 21 and over (the age of majority in Ireland). As a result, we were turned away several times before finally settling in a bar. With the noise and the lack of effort from the Irish to understand English, you will need to repeat your order several times. The pint at 10 euros was a bit off-putting, to be honest. The bars capitalize heavily on their reputation and the location that is Temple Bar. However, the atmosphere is good with singing and dancing. Don't expect to find a seat in the famous Temple Bar itself as it is full from 5 PM to 2 AM. The neighborhood is lively, with a great atmosphere, and is close to public transportation that runs until the early morning. However we strongly recommend ordering from other bars outside this area, as just by walking 100 to 200 meters you could find drinks for a fraction of the price.</p>"
